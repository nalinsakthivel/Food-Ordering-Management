Letâ€™s concentrate on booking area in a restaurant. In traditional booking system, a customer has to make a phone call in Order to get his meal reserved. For each booking he has to register manually on paper and puts the Order in a queue with specific priority according to time and quantity, and then a cook is assigned for the specific Order to complete it. This is the system for manage the restaurant business. The main point of developing this system is to help restaurant administrator manage the restaurant business and help customer for online ordering. The project is developing because; many restaurants have a lot difficult to manage the business such as customer ordering.
